# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1
It is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal movement using activity monitoring devices such as a Fitbit, Nike Fuelband, or Jawbone Up. These type of devices are part of the ‚Äúquantified self‚Äù movement ‚Äì a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks.

## Loading and preprocessing the data
Load the activity data and explore it.


```r
Activity <- read.csv ("~/Desktop/RepData_PeerAssessment1/Activity.csv")
head(Activity)
```

```
##   steps       date interval
## 1    NA 2012-10-01        0
## 2    NA 2012-10-01        5
## 3    NA 2012-10-01       10
## 4    NA 2012-10-01       15
## 5    NA 2012-10-01       20
## 6    NA 2012-10-01       25
```

```r
str(Activity)
```

```
## 'data.frame':	17568 obs. of  3 variables:
##  $ steps   : int  NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...
##  $ date    : Factor w/ 61 levels "2012-10-01","2012-10-02",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
##  $ interval: int  0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 ...
```
#### Ploting the Histogram of the steps
Plotting the histogram of the daily steps using the base plot system.

```r
daily <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = Activity, sum, na.rm = TRUE)
hist(daily$steps,breaks = 15, main = "The Histogram of Daily Steps", xlab = "Number of steps", col = "red")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
The mean and the median of the daily data aggregated earlier is calculated and printed.

```r
Mean <- mean(daily$steps)
print(paste("The mean of daily activity is", round(Mean, 3)))
```

```
## [1] "The mean of daily activity is 10766.189"
```

```r
Median <- median(daily$steps)
print(paste("The median of daily activity is", Median))
```

```
## [1] "The median of daily activity is 10765"
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

Calculating the average of daily activity pattern and plot it to understand the pattern. 


```r
library(ggplot2)
steps.per.interval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data = Activity, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
ggplot(data=steps.per.interval, aes(x=interval, y=steps)) +
    geom_line() +
    xlab("5-minute interval") +
    ylab("average number of steps taken")
```

![](PA1_template_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)

Calculating the max value of the 5 minute interval 

```r
steps.per.interval[which.max(steps.per.interval$steps),]
```

```
##     interval    steps
## 104      835 206.1698
```
## Imputing missing values
Note that there are a number of days/intervals where there are missing values (coded as ùôΩùô∞). The presence of missing days may introduce bias into some calculations or summaries of the data.

Calculating the number of NA in the steps

```r
sum_of_na <- sum (is.na(Activity$steps))
sum_of_na/length(Activity$steps)    # the percentage of NA to the total data
```

```
## [1] 0.1311475
```

Filling the missing data using the mean of interval calculated earlier data 


```r
fill.value <- function(steps, interval) {
    filled <- NA
    if (!is.na(steps))
        filled <- c(steps)
    else
        filled <- (steps.per.interval[steps.per.interval$interval==interval, "steps"])
    return(filled)
}
filled.NA<- Activity
filled.NA$steps <- mapply(fill.value, filled.NA$steps, filled.NA$interval)
```

Calculating the mean and median of daily data after filling the NA values


```r
filled.daily <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = filled.NA, sum, na.rm = TRUE)
filled.mean <- mean(filled.daily$steps)
filled.median <- median(filled.daily$steps)

print(paste("The mean of the original data is",round(Mean, 5), "and the mean of the data after filling the NA is",round(filled.mean, 5)))
```

```
## [1] "The mean of the original data is 10766.18868 and the mean of the data after filling the NA is 10766.18868"
```

```r
print(paste("The median of the original data is",Median, "and the median of the data after filling the NA is",round(filled.median,5 )))
```

```
## [1] "The median of the original data is 10765 and the median of the data after filling the NA is 10766.18868"
```

Ploting the histogram after filling the NA values

```r
hist(filled.daily$steps,breaks = 15, main = "The Histogram of Daily Steps filled NA", xlab = "Number of steps", col = "red")
```

![](PA1_template_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)

From the result, it can be seen that the filling of the NA field is not affecting the result significantly as they don't constitute a high percentage of the whole data. 

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
