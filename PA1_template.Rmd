## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r }
Activity <- read.csv ("~/Desktop/RepData_PeerAssessment1/Activity.csv")
head(Activity)
str(Activity)
```
#### Ploting the Histogram of the steps

```{r }
daily <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = Activity, sum, na.rm = TRUE)
hist(daily$steps,breaks = 15, main = "The Histogram of Daily Steps", xlab = "Number of steps", col = "red")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?


## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
